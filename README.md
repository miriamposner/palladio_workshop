Introductory Palladio Workshop
==========  

Materials (including data, handouts, and slides) for a workshop on Palladio, first offered in November 2014. The data is from Indiana University's Cushman Collection of photographs, located [here](https://github.com/iulibdcs/cushman_photos). I've cleaned this data a bit, geocoded it, and restricted it to the years 1938 to 1952, in order to make it more manageable to work with.
