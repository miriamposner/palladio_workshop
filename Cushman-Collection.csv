An e-mail sent to the Digital Library Program on Jan. 15, 2004 mentioned that ""While I'm willing to believe that the notebook is in error, the George Washington Bridge is located between 178th and 179th, and it is clearly a picture of the Hudson River side of Washington Heights, which is just to the North of the bridge.""



NOTE: The information may be incorrect, but the notebook and slide-mount descriptions have been double-checked, and determined to be

a correct transcription; the e-mail description of

Jan. 15, 2004 may be a more-accurate description of the image.","New York, New York","40.7305991, -73.9865835",,,,Cityscape photographs,,Buildings,Trees,Colonnades,Vines,Women,Columns,Retaining walls,Apartment houses,Columns,,,,"George Washington Bridge (New York, N.Y.)"2666,http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/archives/cushman/P02666,http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/cushman/full/P02666.jpg,1942-10-01T00:00:00Z,"Oct. 1, 1942",New York's old Produce Exchange,"Produce Exchange
